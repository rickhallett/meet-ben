### Overall Use Case
- **Goal:** Create an **agentic, conversational system** to help therapists build a complete psychological formulation of a client, drawing on concepts from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).  
- **Key Functions:**
  1. Maintain a **live, evolving data structure** (graph) representing client information (values, triggers, thoughts, feelings, etc.).
  2. **Agents** (e.g., Evaluating Agent, Questioning Agent, Memory Agent) work together to identify gaps, propose investigations, and update the formulation over time.
  3. Provide an interface (chatbot style) where the therapist can add data, confirm or deny agent suggestions, and track how information is interconnected.

### Major Components & Architecture

1. **Agentic Workflow**
   - Multiple agents, each with a specific role:
     - **Evaluating Agent:** Scans the graph to find weak or underexplored nodes (areas needing more data).
     - **Questioning Agent:** Suggests follow-up questions or prompts to fill knowledge gaps.
     - **Memory Agent:** Maintains the chronological store of updates, tracking changes across sessions.
     - **Feedback/Reflection Agent:** Summarizes insights or highlights patterns for therapist review.
   - Agents communicate via a **Coordinator** or orchestrating logic that decides which agent should act next based on the current state of the formulation.

2. **Graph-Based Data Structure**
   - **Choice of Library:** 
     - **NetworkX** is recommended for its balance of simplicity, flexibility, built-in graph algorithms, and ease of setup within a tight timeframe (e.g., 4 days).
     - Other options considered include dictionary-based custom structures, dataclasses, PyGraphML, graph-tool, Neo4j, igraph, and specialized temporal graph libraries like DynGraph.  
     - **Reasons for choosing NetworkX**:
       1. Rapid prototyping with minimal overhead.
       2. Ready-made algorithms (centrality, traversal, etc.).
       3. Easy to add custom node/edge attributes (timestamps, weights, notes).

   - **Node & Edge Attributes**:
     - **Nodes** represent concepts (values, triggers, PF dimensions), each storing:
       - A **type** (e.g., 'value', 'trigger'),
       - **Content** (e.g., "Creativity", "Fear of judgment"),
       - **Timestamps** (list of session updates),
       - **Weight/Confidence** (indicating how well-defined the node is),
       - Additional metadata (notes, session references).
     - **Edges** represent relationships (e.g., "linked_concept", "avoidance_of", "supports"), each with:
       - A **type** (nature of relationship),
       - **Weight** (strength or completeness of the connection),
       - **Timestamps** (tracking when and how the edge was formed or updated).
   - **Temporal Dimension**:
     - A crucial aspect is capturing how nodes/edges evolve across sessions (session numbers, date/time).
     - This allows the system to prompt meta-level reflections (e.g., “Leadership value gained importance between sessions 3 and 5”).

3. **Chatbot Engine & Flow**
   - **Conversational Interface**: 
     - Could be built using a simple Flask or FastAPI backend where the therapist interacts with agents through text input.
     - Agents parse new inputs, propose node/edge updates to the graph, then ask for **confirmation** (“Do I understand this correctly?”).
   - **Confirmation Step**: 
     - Whenever new data is extracted or existing data is updated, the system summarizes proposed changes (e.g., new node creation, edge updates).
     - The therapist can **approve**, **reject**, or **modify** these suggestions, ensuring human oversight and preventing misinterpretation.
   - **Agent Triggers**:
     - **Evaluating Agent** runs after each update to scan for underrepresented areas (low-weight nodes, missing edges).
     - **Questioning Agent** prompts the therapist with relevant inquiries to fill these gaps.

4. **Data Collection and Updating**
   - As the therapist or user adds **clinical notes** (free text or structured forms), the system:
     1. Uses LLM-based parsing to identify key phrases or new data.
     2. Suggests relevant node or edge updates, linking them to existing parts of the graph if appropriate.
   - **Temporal Updates**:
     - Each session or note gets logged with a timestamp, enhancing the chronological narrative of client data.
     - Agents can reflect on how a node’s understanding has deepened or changed over time.

### Detailed Technical Elements

1. **Core Graph Operations in NetworkX**
   - **Adding Nodes**:
     ```python
     G.add_node(
       node_id, 
       type="value",
       content="Creativity",
       weight=0.8,
       timestamps=[{"session": 1, "note": "Identified as core value"}]
     )
     ```
   - **Adding Edges**:
     ```python
     G.add_edge(
       source_node, 
       target_node,
       type="linked_concept",
       weight=0.5,
       timestamps=[{"session": 2, "note": "Link discovered"}]
     )
     ```
   - **Querying**: Use NetworkX functions (`G.nodes(data=True)`, `G.edges(data=True)`) or built-in algorithms (centrality, etc.).

2. **Implementing Agents**
   - **Evaluating Agent**:
     - Checks node weights or connectivity to find “weak nodes.”
     - Uses centrality measures or a custom threshold to highlight areas needing exploration.
   - **Questioning Agent**:
     - Generates follow-up questions for the therapist based on identified weaknesses or new data.
     - Example: “We have insufficient details on how 'Fear of judgment' relates to 'Leadership'—would you like to explore that?”
   - **Memory Agent**:
     - Stores historical data, can present timeline-based updates or changes in node/edge attributes across sessions.
   - **Feedback Agent**:
     - Summarizes progress, changes in patterns, or newly formed conceptual links after each session.

3. **Proposed Timeline for a 4-Day MVP**
   - **Day 1**: 
     - Set up basic NetworkX graph structure.  
     - Implement minimal node/edge addition with timestamps.
   - **Day 2**: 
     - Build the Evaluating Agent (scanning graph, spotting weak points).  
     - Build the Questioning Agent (simple follow-up prompts).
   - **Day 3**: 
     - Implement a basic web service (Flask/FastAPI) for the therapist to add data and confirm updates.  
     - Integrate the agents into the chatbot flow.
   - **Day 4**: 
     - Refine the system, test end-to-end functionality, incorporate any minor visualization or meta-reflection features.

### Future Considerations & Scalability

1. **Advanced Temporal Tools**:
   - If the project grows, consider specialized libraries for dynamic graphs (e.g., DynGraph) or a graph database (Neo4j) for robust time-based queries.
2. **AI/LLM Integration**:
   - LLMs can parse free-text notes and produce structured summaries for the graph.  
   - Over time, the system can learn which suggestions or connections the therapist frequently approves, refining its suggestions.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Libraries such as PyVis or matplotlib with NetworkX can create interactive views.  
   - A timeline view can depict the evolution of nodes/edges, highlighting how therapy data has expanded or changed.
4. **Ethical & Clinical Caution**:
   - The system is meant to **augment** therapists, not replace them.  
   - Ensuring data accuracy and human oversight remains crucial, especially for sensitive clinical contexts.

### Key Takeaways for Porting or Reuse
- **Graph Choice:** NetworkX is the go-to for quick prototypes combining ease of use and built-in analytics.  
- **Data Model:** Time-aware node/edge attributes (type, content, timestamps, weight) keep the structure flexible for ACT-based or other psychological formulations.  
- **Agents & Roles:** Distinct agents for evaluation, questioning, memory, and feedback help modularize logic, making it easier to expand or swap out functionalities.  
- **Confirmation Logic:** A manual confirmation step is vital for validating system-generated insights and maintaining therapist autonomy.  
- **Tight Timeframe Implementation:** A 4-day MVP is feasible if each day is dedicated to a specific aspect: data structure, agent logic, chatbot integration, final refinements.
