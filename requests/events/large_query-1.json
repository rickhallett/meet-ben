  "query": "Initial Clinical Assessment - ACT Framework\n\nClient presented with significant anxiety symptoms that have persisted for over 15 years. Reports experiencing frequent panic attacks, particularly in social situations. Client describes feeling 'trapped' by their anxiety, noting that it has significantly impacted their personal and professional life. Early experiences include a highly critical parent and several incidents of public embarrassment in school that appear to have contributed to their current patterns of avoidance.\n\nThe client demonstrates strong experiential avoidance, frequently using distraction and withdrawal as primary coping mechanisms. They report difficulty staying present during anxiety-provoking situations and often engage in detailed mental planning to avoid potential triggers. While they show good insight into how avoidance has limited their life choices, they struggle to take actions that might lead to discomfort.\n\nValues exploration reveals a desire for meaningful relationships and career advancement, but these are significantly impacted by fear of judgment and failure. The client expresses frustration with the disconnect between their aspirations and current behaviors. They have attempted various self-help strategies, including meditation and self-help books, but report difficulty maintaining these practices when anxiety intensifies.\n\nCognitive fusion is evident in their relationship with thoughts about inadequacy and social judgment. They demonstrate a strong belief in thoughts such as 'I must appear confident at all times' and 'If I show anxiety, others will think I'm weak.' These fused thoughts appear to significantly influence their behavior and decision-making.\n\nThe client shows potential for psychological flexibility, demonstrating moments of willingness to discuss uncomfortable experiences during the session. They expressed interest in learning new ways to relate to their anxiety and showed particular curiosity about mindfulness approaches, despite their previous challenges with meditation.\n\nInitial treatment goals include:\n1. Developing greater awareness of avoidance patterns\n2. Building skills for staying present with difficult emotions\n3. Clarifying values and identifying small steps toward valued actions\n4. Reducing the impact of fused thoughts about social judgment\n\nRecommended approach includes regular ACT sessions focusing on present-moment awareness, defusion techniques, and gradual exposure to avoided situations within a values-based framework. The client's willingness to engage in therapy and their insight into their patterns suggest good potential for therapeutic progress.",
