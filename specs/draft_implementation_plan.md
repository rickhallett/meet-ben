**Day 1: Core Graph and Minimal Agent**  
- **Set up NetworkX**: Create a basic directed (or undirected) graph structure with minimal node/edge attributes (type, content).  
- **Basic Node/Edge Management**: Implement functions to add nodes/edges with timestamps and simple weighting.  
- **Prototype “Memory Agent”**: Only stores each addition/update in chronological order. Limited logic—just confirm that data is properly persisted.  
- **Test Case**: Manually add a single “value” node and a single “trigger” node, link them, and confirm the stored timestamps/weights.

**Day 2: Evaluation and Questioning Agents**  
- **Evaluating Agent**:
  - Implement a simple node inspection (e.g., if `weight < X` or node degree < 1, mark as “underexplored”).  
  - No advanced algorithms yet—just a threshold-based scan.  
- **Questioning Agent**:
  - When the Evaluating Agent flags an underexplored node, generate a follow-up question (hardcoded or template-based).  
  - Prompt for more detail (e.g., “Can you say more about this node?”).  
- **Refinement**:
  - Add partial confirmation steps: the system proposes an update; the user can accept, reject, or edit.  
- **Test Case**: Add multiple nodes. Trigger the Evaluating Agent to find any low-weight nodes. Let the Questioning Agent prompt the user for clarifications.

**Day 3: Chatbot Interface and Coordinator**  
- **Coordinator/Orchestration**:
  - Introduce simple logic deciding which agent runs next (e.g., after new data is added, run Evaluating Agent → if something is flagged, invoke Questioning Agent → store changes via Memory Agent).  
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Build a minimal Flask/FastAPI endpoint for text input.  
  - Display agent prompts and user responses.  
  - Support the confirmation step: user sees proposed graph updates and can confirm/edit/reject.  
- **Test Case**:
  - Simulate a short therapy session. Input free text describing one or two client details, watch the entire flow (Coordination → Evaluation → Questioning → Memory).  

**Day 4: Feedback Agent and End-to-End Polish**  
- **Feedback Agent**:
  - Summarize changes after each session (e.g., “Here’s what we added,” “Here are patterns identified”).  
  - Implement a basic function that scans new nodes/edges since last session and composes a short summary.  
- **Refine Data Structures**:
  - Add finer-grained metadata (session IDs, note references, updated weight logic).  
  - Ensure each agent properly updates the graph with timestamps.  
- **Validation and Testing**:
  - Run a mock multi-session flow, verifying chronological entries, agent triggers, and user confirmations.  
  - Optional: Add a simple visualization with NetworkX’s built-in drawing or PyVis to confirm node/edge relationships.  

**Further Iterations**  
- **LLM-Based Parsing**: Replace or supplement the Questioning Agent’s hardcoded prompts with more sophisticated text extraction from user notes.  
- **Advanced Evaluations**: Use NetworkX centrality measures for more nuanced “underexplored” detection.  
- **Temporal Views**: Expand the Memory Agent to let users see progression over sessions, highlighting new or modified nodes.  
- **Data Volume Scaling**: Consider a persistent graph database (Neo4j) if the system grows beyond in-memory needs.
