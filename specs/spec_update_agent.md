# Agents

Agents are PydanticAI's primary interface for interacting with LLMs.

In some use cases a single Agent will control an entire application or component, but multiple agents can also interact to embody more complex workflows.

The Agent class has full API documentation, but conceptually you can think of an agent as a container for:

## Component	Description
- System prompt(s)	A set of instructions for the LLM written by the developer.
- Function tool(s)	Functions that the LLM may call to get information while generating a response.
- Structured result type	The structured datatype the LLM must return at the end of a run, if specified.
- Dependency type constraint	System prompt functions, tools, and result validators may all use dependencies when they're run.
- LLM model	Optional default LLM model associated with the agent. Can also be specified when running the agent.
- Model Settings	Optional default model settings to help fine tune requests. Can also be specified when running the agent.

In typing terms, agents are generic in their dependency and result types, e.g., an agent which required dependencies of type Foobar and returned results of type list[str] would have type Agent[Foobar, list[str]]. In practice, you shouldn't need to care about this, it should just mean your IDE can tell you when you have the right type, and if you choose to use static type checking it should work well with PydanticAI.

Agents are designed for reuse, like FastAPI Apps

Agents are intended to be instantiated once (frequently as module globals) and reused throughout your application, similar to a small FastAPI app or an APIRouter.
```

```python
"""Here's a toy example of an agent that simulates a roulette wheel:"""

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

roulette_agent = Agent(  
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=int,
    result_type=bool,
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the `roulette_wheel` function to see if the '
        'customer has won based on the number they provide.'
    ),
)


@roulette_agent.tool
async def roulette_wheel(ctx: RunContext[int], square: int) -> str:  
    """check if the square is a winner"""
    return 'winner' if square == ctx.deps else 'loser'


# Run the agent
success_number = 18  
result = roulette_agent.run_sync('Put my money on square eighteen', deps=success_number)
print(result.data)  
#> True

result = roulette_agent.run_sync('I bet five is the winner', deps=success_number)
print(result.data)
#> False

```md
### Running Agents
There are three ways to run an agent:

- `agent.run()` — a coroutine which returns a RunResult containing a completed response
- `agent.run_sync()` — a plain, synchronous function which returns a RunResult containing a completed response (internally, this just calls loop.run_until_complete(self.run()))
- `agent.run_stream()` — a coroutine which returns a StreamedRunResult, which contains methods to stream a response as an async iterable
```

```python
"""Here's a simple example demonstrating all three:"""
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

result_sync = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of Italy?')
print(result_sync.data)
#> Rome


async def main():
    result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
    print(result.data)
    #> Paris

    async with agent.run_stream('What is the capital of the UK?') as response:
        print(await response.get_data())
        #> London

"""
(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" — you'll need to add asyncio.run(main()) to run main)
You can also pass messages from previous runs to continue a conversation or provide context, as described in Messages and Chat History.
"""
```

```python
"""
Additional Configuration
Usage Limits
PydanticAI offers a UsageLimits structure to help you limit your usage (tokens and/or requests) on model runs.

You can apply these settings by passing the usage_limits argument to the run{_sync,_stream} functions.

Consider the following example, where we limit the number of response tokens:
"""
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import UsageLimitExceeded
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits

agent = Agent('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')

result_sync = agent.run_sync(
    'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with just the city.',
    usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
)
print(result_sync.data)
#> Rome
print(result_sync.usage())
"""
Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=62, response_tokens=1, total_tokens=63, details=None)
"""

try:
    result_sync = agent.run_sync(
        'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with a paragraph.',
        usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
    )
except UsageLimitExceeded as e:
    print(e)
    #> Exceeded the response_tokens_limit of 10 (response_tokens=32)

```

```python
"""
Restricting the number of requests can be useful in preventing infinite loops or excessive tool calling:
"""
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelRetry
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import UsageLimitExceeded
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits


class NeverResultType(TypedDict):
    """
    Never ever coerce data to this type.
    """

    never_use_this: str


agent = Agent(
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
    result_type=NeverResultType,
    system_prompt='Any time you get a response, call the `infinite_retry_tool` to produce another response.',
)


@agent.tool_plain(retries=5)  
def infinite_retry_tool() -> int:
    raise ModelRetry('Please try again.')


try:
    result_sync = agent.run_sync(
        'Begin infinite retry loop!', usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=3)  
    )
except UsageLimitExceeded as e:
    print(e)
    #> The next request would exceed the request_limit of 3
```

```python
"""Model (Run) Settings
PydanticAI offers a settings.ModelSettings structure to help you fine tune your requests. This structure allows you to configure common parameters that influence the model's behavior, such as temperature, max_tokens, timeout, and more.

There are two ways to apply these settings: 1. Passing to run{_sync,_stream} functions via the model_settings argument. This allows for fine-tuning on a per-request basis. 2. Setting during Agent initialization via the model_settings argument. These settings will be applied by default to all subsequent run calls using said agent. However, model_settings provided during a specific run call will override the agent's default settings.

For example, if you'd like to set the temperature setting to 0.0 to ensure less random behavior, you can do the following:
"""

from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

result_sync = agent.run_sync(
    'What is the capital of Italy?', model_settings={'temperature': 0.0}
)
print(result_sync.data)
#> Rome

```

```python
"""Runs vs. Conversations
An agent run might represent an entire conversation — there's no limit to how many messages can be exchanged in a single run. However, a conversation might also be composed of multiple runs, especially if you need to maintain state between separate interactions or API calls.

Here's an example of a conversation comprised of multiple runs:
"""

from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

# First run
result1 = agent.run_sync('Who was Albert Einstein?')
print(result1.data)
#> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

# Second run, passing previous messages
result2 = agent.run_sync(
    'What was his most famous equation?',
    message_history=result1.new_messages(),  
)
print(result2.data)
#> Albert Einstein's most famous equation is (E = mc^2).

```

```python
"""Type safe by design
PydanticAI is designed to work well with static type checkers, like mypy and pyright.

In particular, agents are generic in both the type of their dependencies and the type of results they return, so you can use the type hints to ensure you're using the right types.

Consider the following script with type mistakes:
"""
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str


agent = Agent(
    'test',
    deps_type=User,  
    result_type=bool,
)


@agent.system_prompt
def add_user_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:  
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


def foobar(x: bytes) -> None:
    pass


result = agent.run_sync('Does their name start with "A"?', deps=User('Anne'))
foobar(result.data)

"""
Running mypy on this will give the following output: (Running pyright would identify the same issues.)
"""
```

```bash
➤ uv run mypy type_mistakes.py
type_mistakes.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "system_prompt" of "Agent" has incompatible type "Callable[[RunContext[str]], str]"; expected "Callable[[RunContext[User]], str]"  [arg-type]
type_mistakes.py:28: error: Argument 1 to "foobar" has incompatible type "bool"; expected "bytes"  [arg-type]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```


```python
"""
System Prompts
System prompts might seem simple at first glance since they're just strings (or sequences of strings that are concatenated), but crafting the right system prompt is key to getting the model to behave as you want.

Generally, system prompts fall into two categories:

Static system prompts: These are known when writing the code and can be defined via the system_prompt parameter of the Agent constructor.
Dynamic system prompts: These depend in some way on context that isn't known until runtime, and should be defined via functions decorated with @agent.system_prompt.
You can add both to a single agent; they're appended in the order they're defined at runtime.

Here's an example using both types of system prompts:
"""
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=str,  
    system_prompt="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",  
)


@agent.system_prompt  
def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


@agent.system_prompt
def add_the_date() -> str:  
    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'


result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')
print(result.data)
#> Hello Frank, the date today is 2032-01-02.

```

```python
"""
Reflection and self-correction
Validation errors from both function tool parameter validation and structured result validation can be passed back to the model with a request to retry.

You can also raise ModelRetry from within a tool or result validator function to tell the model it should retry generating a response.

The default retry count is 1 but can be altered for the entire agent, a specific tool, or a result validator.
You can access the current retry count from within a tool or result validator via ctx.retry.
Here's an example:
"""

from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, ModelRetry

from fake_database import DatabaseConn


class ChatResult(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    message: str


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=DatabaseConn,
    result_type=ChatResult,
)


@agent.tool(retries=2)
def get_user_by_name(ctx: RunContext[DatabaseConn], name: str) -> int:
    """Get a user's ID from their full name."""
    print(name)
    #> John
    #> John Doe
    user_id = ctx.deps.users.get(name=name)
    if user_id is None:
        raise ModelRetry(
            f'No user found with name {name!r}, remember to provide their full name'
        )
    return user_id


result = agent.run_sync(
    'Send a message to John Doe asking for coffee next week', deps=DatabaseConn()
)
print(result.data)
"""
user_id=123 message='Hello John, would you be free for coffee sometime next week? Let me know what works for you!'
"""

```

```python
"""
Model errors
If models behave unexpectedly (e.g., the retry limit is exceeded, or their API returns 503), agent runs will raise UnexpectedModelBehavior.

In these cases, capture_run_messages can be used to access the messages exchanged during the run to help diagnose the issue.
"""
